**Mine Chest** is a Node.JS application designed to run on the cloud that wraps a [Minecraft Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) adding functionalities such as game status handling (stopping, pausing) and  snapshot backups and restores through a simple HTTP API. It plays the role of a [chest](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chest) for a server: your saves will always be there for you when you ~respawn~ publish a new instance.
